# DotNet, Introduction

Microsoft DotNet, is a technology I haven't really used that much before...; but, am still in the process of learning 'how to' use, right now.

-----

## Where to download...

Microsoft Dotnet can be downloaded for FREE from...

- https://dotnet.microsoft.com

## Checking if DotNet is correctly installed on your system...

The first thing one needs to do is check...after already downloading/and, installing the program...to test seeing if DotNet has been installed, correctly, on your computer system; which, in my own case, as of the date/time: 20th June 2022 15:57 PM GMT, happens to be Windows 10 Professional operating system.    

1. Open up a DOS command line prompt window...; and, type in after the command line prompt...  

C:\\>dotnet  

Usage: dotnet [options]  
Usage: dotnet [path-to-application]  

Options:  
  -h|--help         Display help.  
  --info            Display .NET information.  
  --list-sdks       Display the installed SDKs.  
  --list-runtimes   Display the installed runtimes.  

path-to-application:  
  The path to an application .dll file to execute.  

...if you get returned back the above list of results; then, that should mean, yes, you have successfully installed DotNet. Very well done! ;-)
